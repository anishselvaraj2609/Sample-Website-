                KTM founder Hans Trunkenpolz, circa 1937.

The story of KTM begins in 1934, long before the idea of high-performance racing bikes and supercars were even conceptualized. Austrian engineer Hans Trunkenpolz opened a car repair shop in Mattighofen. Three years later, Trunkenpolz’s shop was selling DKW motorcycles and the following year, had added Opel automobiles to his company’s offerings. The shop came to be known as Kraftfahrzeug Trunkenpolz Mattighofen: Kraftfahrzeug, the German word for motor vehicle, Trunkenpolz, named after its founder Hans Trunkenpolz; and Mattighofen, the location of the shop. This was the beginning of the KTM brand name.


<p><b>1.   KTM R100</b></p>

<p>1.1. During World War II, KTM sustained itself through diesel engine repair jobs and Trunkenpolz’s wife managed the business. The end of World War II saw an almost instantaneous decline in engine repair jobs which led to Trunkenpolz considering the creation and production of his very own motorcycle. Unlike BMW, which was a major supplier to the Third Reich, KTM was not encumbered by the same post-war manufacturing restrictions that were handed down to other former Axis companies by the newly-formed United Nations. Trunkenpolz prototyped his first motorcycle in 1951 called the R100. The R100 used all bespoke in-house parts, except for the Rotax engines sourced by Fitchel & Sachs. Production of the R100 began in 1953 with a team of only 20 employees (including Johann Trunkenpolz, himself). The team was able to produce 3 complete motorcycles per day. That same year, Trunkenpolz partnered with businessman Ernst Kronreif who became a major investor and shareholder of KTM. The company was then renamed Kronreif & Trunkenpolz Mattighofen. The following two years brought forth the introduction of three new products, the R125 Tourist in 1954 and the Grand Tourist and Mirabell scooter in 1955..
